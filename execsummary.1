We propose the Galactic Stellar Instability-strip Map (GALSIM), a two-hemisphere near-infrared spectroscopic survey of variable stars in the disk and bulge of the Milky Way. The distance and age indicators of our intended targets present an opportunity to transform our understanding of the Galaxy today as it is today and crucially constain its evolutionary history into the past. By directly building upon the success of the APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 surveys, taking advantage of new photometric and astrosnometric targeting information, and levaging newly-established advances in abundance analysis, the currently envisioned survey does not require any hardware upgrade or telesope facility modification.

GALSIM pushes the frontier of Galactic Archeology. The survey will, for the first time, use stellar tracers to map the chemical composition of the ISM across the MW, providing the strongest constraints yet on our Galaxy's formation history. GALSIM will also produce an order of magnitude more precise chemodynamical map of the Bulge and far disk; these regions trace the majority of our Galaxy's mass but are too obscured by dust to be observable at visual wavelengths. 
GAIA cannot measure parallaxes and proper motions will not be avIn the After SDSS-IV era, the lack of precise distance measures  will be the limiting factor to Galactic cartography efforts. To accomplish its science goals, GALSIM will target  a total of $\sim10^5$ variable stars with robust distance (luminosity?) indicators.


Need distance PLUS chemistry. GAIA distances can only help (cause its deep) visual spectroscopic surveys cannot go where we go.

Using established color-cuts and newly-developed identification algorithms, the fiducial survey strategy will efficiently target and observe $\sim10^5$ variable stars with excellent distance diagnostics: Cepheids, Red Clump stars, and RR Lyraes.

To accomplish these goals, the survey exploits the existing and robust distance indicators of three main target classes lying in the instability strip region of the HR diagram.
